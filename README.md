Project Title:
Automated Software Testing with Selenium WebDriver

Project Description:
This project involves the development and implementation of an automated software testing framework using Selenium WebDriver. 
The primary technologies utilized in this project include Java, Maven, TestNG, and POJO classes. 
The framework is designed to read data from Excel files, perform file upload operations, and capture screenshots of the test results. 
The project employs a base class to facilitate code reuse and uses POJO classes for encapsulation.

Key features of the project include:
1.	Automated Testing with Selenium WebDriver: Leveraged Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions and verify application functionality.
2.	Java and Maven Integration: Utilized Java for scripting and Maven for project management and dependency resolution.
3.	TestNG Framework: Implemented TestNG for test case management, parallel execution, and reporting.
4.	Excel Data Handling: Integrated Apache POI to read and write data from Excel files for data-driven testing.
5.	File Upload Automation: Automated file upload functionality to test application file handling capabilities.
6.	Screenshot Capture: Developed methods to capture and save screenshots of test results for debugging and reporting purposes.
7.	Base Class for Code Reuse: Created a base class to centralize common methods and utilities, enhancing code maintainability and reducing redundancy.
8.	Encapsulation with POJO Classes: Designed POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes to encapsulate and manage test data.

Project Summary:
An automated software testing framework utilizing Selenium WebDriver, Java, Maven, and TestNG to enhance test efficiency and accuracy. 
The project includes features for reading Excel data, automating file uploads, and capturing screenshots. 
A base class is implemented for code reuse, and POJO classes are used for data encapsulation. 
This framework significantly improves testing processes and ensures robust application quality.
